## Stat 111's history 
- Usually co-taught with Neil Shephard
	- Currently on Sabbatical
	- Neil is the first joint professor in Stat and Econ
	- Joe and Neil are writing a Stat 111 book
- Blast from the past: Joe hasn't taught in Hall C since before COVID
- Unfortunately, publishing the Stat 110 book tanked Joe's teaching reviews
	- Because the book is the accumulation of Ed, teaching experience, etc. 
	- And he wrote the book!
- Chapters 1-3 of the Stat 111 draft book are online
	- Roughly 1 homework per chapter
- Not as many practice exams for midterm/final due to changing course structure
-
