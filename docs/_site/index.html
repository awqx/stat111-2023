<p>This site holds the course notes for aL.</p>

<p>The course Canvas site is <a href="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/119000">here</a>. Section files will be duplicated under the Files section of Canvas, found <a href="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/119000/files/folder/Section%20Materials/aL">here</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, R markdown files and PDFs are available on the GitHub repo of this site, found <a href="https://github.com/awqx/stat111-2023">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>

<h3 id="whenwhere-are-section-and-office-hours">When/where are section and office hours?</h3>

<p>My section will be held on Thursdays, 3:00-4:15 PM, in SC 110. They are scheduled for people who want to jump into the material right after lecture. Sections will cover that week’s material, i.e., the material due for the pset due the week after, not the day after.</p>

<p>My office hours will be held right after section on Thursdays, 4:30-6:30 PM, in SC 316 (Data Science Lounge).</p>

<h3 id="is-that-a-5-hour-block-of-stat-111">Is that a 5 hour block of Stat 111?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3 id="help-i-cant-make-it-to-in-person-section-or-office-hours">Help! I can’t make it to in-person section or office hours.</h3>

<p>First, try posting on <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/32950/discussion/">Ed</a>. Make the question <em>private</em> if it involves your personal work that would violate the Honor Code if shared for every student. Make the question <em>public</em> if it’s a general clarifying question, including questions about how a problem is worded/expectations of work, content covered in lecture or the textbook, or course guidelines.</p>

<p>If a question is urgent, do NOT email me because I already get instant email notifications from Ed (it is categorically worse because on Ed the entire teaching staff can respond to help you). The only faster way I would respond is through instant messaging services, which I will not publicize and you will have to ask for in-person or through email.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-this-website-exist">Why does this website exist?</h3>

<p>It’s quicker to modify, especially because my section’s content will reflect the lecture that occurs before. It’s also a little easier to browse through than Canvas, which (at least for me) has annoying delays every time I open a document or navigate the file tree.</p>

<h3 id="where-are-the-r-markdown-files">Where are the R Markdown files?</h3>

<p>All the files are visible in the site repository on GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/awqx/stat111-2023">Go here</a>. The link is also available in the sidebar.</p>

<p>Individual pages will also be linked to their respective R markdown and PDF documents.</p>
