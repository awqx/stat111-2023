Here's a quick, bulleted list of information found on the syllabus that you might want to search intermittently. I've omitted things people should know by now, like where/when the class is and the simultaneous enrollment policy.

## Important dates/times
- **March 7**: 75-minute, in-class midterm
- **TBD**: in-person, 3 hour final exam (waiting for registrar date)
- Homework due 5 PM Friday on Gradescope (15 minute grace period)
- Monday extensions are until 5 PM Monday (15 minute grace period)

## Homework
- **1 drop**: lowest score
- **4 Monday extensions**
	- If you don't submit a homework, that will be dropped but will not affect your count of Monday extensions 
	- We will not grant extra extensions
- Drops and extensions are auto-calculated
- For full credit, include:
	- Properly labeled pages in Gradescope
	- Code used to solve problems
	- Names of collaborators
	- Citations for relevant results/enough work
	- Text! Not diagrams!
- Use Ed to ask questions
	- But please search for similar ones before asking

## Grading
- Let $h, m, f$ be the homework average, midterm score, and final exam score, all out of 100. Then, the overall course score is the maximum of the two possible calculations of $s$:
	- $s = 0.45 h + 0.2 m + 0.35f$
	- $s = 0.45h + 0.1m + 0.45f$
	- Your homework contribution is constant; this scheme allows people leeway if they improve a lot between midterm and final
