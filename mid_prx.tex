\hypertarget{midterm-practice}{%
\section{Midterm practice}\label{midterm-practice}}

This practice material is expected to take longer than 75 minutes. If
one problem is incomplete after 75 minutes you're probably fine for
pacing. If 2+ problems are unfinished, you may need to drill practice
problems for speed so you have time to check answers during the midterm.

\hypertarget{truefalse}{%
\subsection{1 True/false}\label{truefalse}}

If false, explain why. For people simulating a midterm, don't spend too
long on this section at the expense of working on other practice. If
you're spending longer than 2 minutes on any T/F question, skip it and
look up the solution later.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Asymptotically, the MLE is unbiased.
\item
  Asymptotically, the MLE has the lowest MSE of any estimator.
\item
  If a sequence converges in distribution to a constant, then it also
  converges in probability to that constant.
\item
  Given a sequence \(T_1, T_2, \dots\) of estimators for the estimand
  \(\theta\) such that \(\mathbb{E}[T_i] = \theta\) for any \(i\), then
  the estimator is consistent, i.e., \(T_n \overset{p}{\to} \theta\).
\item
  By the bias-variance tradeoff, for any given estimator, an alternate
  estimator with lower bias will have higher variance.
\item
  The MoM estimator is guaranteed to be unbiased.
\item
  If \(\mathbf T\) is a sufficient statistic for the data, then we can
  find the MLE using only \(\mathbf T\) without observing the entirety
  of the data.
\item
  A given likelihood function will have a unique sufficient statistic.
\item
  Removing multiplicative constants from log-likelihood calculation
  before finding the MLE will result in a change of the point estimate
  of the MLE.
\item
  For \(n\) observations, the Fisher information of the data is always
  \(n\) times the Fisher information of a single observation.
\item
  The MLE of the parameter \(\theta\) for a Uniform distribution from
  \(0, \theta\) is asymptotically Normal with variance given as the
  inverse of the Fisher info of one observation.
\item
  If \(X, Y\) are independent, then \(g(X), h(Y)\) are also independent
  for functions \(g, h\).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{exponential-modeling}{%
\subsection{2 Exponential modeling}\label{exponential-modeling}}

Emily sets up a sensor to detect radioactive decay from a sample. Assume
that the times between radioactive particle detection can be modeled as
Exponential with rate parameter \(\lambda\), with units in minutes. Data
is collected in the form \(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n\), where \(y_i\) is the
interarrival time between the \(i\)th and \(i - 1\)th particle (where
\(y_0 = 0\)).

\hypertarget{mle}{%
\subsubsection{2.1 MLE}\label{mle}}

\hypertarget{likelihood-function}{%
\paragraph{2.1.1 Likelihood function}\label{likelihood-function}}

Write out the likelihood, log-likelihood, and solve for the MLE.

\hypertarget{nef}{%
\paragraph{2.1.2 NEF}\label{nef}}

Verify the above using properties of NEFs.

\hypertarget{broken-sensor}{%
\subsubsection{2.2 Broken sensor}\label{broken-sensor}}

When setting up the sensor, Emily finds that it automatically shuts down
every hour. Emily can't figure out how to stop this, but can jerry-rig a
setup to restart the sensor when it turns off. Emily can record the
number of times the sensor restarts but not the times when it happens.

Rewrite the likelihood and solve for the MLE.

\hypertarget{sleep-average}{%
\subsection{3 Sleep average}\label{sleep-average}}

This is a pretty contrived setup, so ignore how this would be a
questionable experiment IRL.

Sia is researching whether the average sleep time of Harvard students
differs from the 2013 reported national average of 6.8 hours
(\href{https://news.gallup.com/poll/166553/less-recommended-amount-sleep.aspx}{Gallup}).
She (somehow) gets the average sleep data for \(n\) students and
subtracts \(6.8\) from the collected data (to center the data around
zero if average of Harvard students and the national average line up).

Sia doesn't know the standard deviation, but she can estimate it with
the data (assume \(n\) is large enough). Assume we're using the sample
variance to estimate variance and taking the square root to get sample
error.

\hypertarget{single-ci}{%
\subsubsection{3.1 Single CI}\label{single-ci}}

Clarification: the estimand of interest is the mean of the data after
6.8 has been subtracted off. So your answer should not have 6.8
anywhere.

Let the sample mean of the data (post-subtraction) be the point estimate
for the estimand. Use the appropriate pivot to construct a
\(100(1 - \alpha)\) percent confidence interval.

\hypertarget{multiple-cis}{%
\subsubsection{3.2 Multiple CIs}\label{multiple-cis}}

Sia wants to also look at whether certain concentrations deviate from
the national average. So, she sorts her data into \(m\) concentrations.
For this problem, assume that the concentrations are independent.

\hypertarget{independence-assumptions}{%
\paragraph{3.2.1 Independence
assumptions}\label{independence-assumptions}}

In what ways should we expect the independence assumption to be
violated?

\hypertarget{coverage-probability}{%
\paragraph{3.2.2 Coverage probability}\label{coverage-probability}}

Each CI collected on a concentration is constructed to have 95 percent
coverage probability. Is it true that the \emph{entire experiment} has
the same coverage probability? That is, can we say ``If we repeated this
experiment, we would expect that \emph{all of our CIs} would cover the
true value of their respective estimands \(100(1 - \alpha)\) percent of
the time.''

If false, evaluate the coverage probability of the entire experiment.

\hypertarget{adjusted-cis}{%
\paragraph{3.2.3 Adjusted CIs}\label{adjusted-cis}}

Spoiler: 3.2.2 is false. Propose an adjusted CI for each of the \(m\)
concentrations such that the entire experiment has \(100(1 - \alpha)\)
percent coverage.

\hypertarget{uniform-cis}{%
\subsection{4 Uniform CIs}\label{uniform-cis}}

Let \(Y_1, \dots, Y_n \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \textrm{Unif}(0, \theta)\).

\hypertarget{properties-of-the-mle}{%
\subsubsection{4.1 Properties of the MLE}\label{properties-of-the-mle}}

\hypertarget{regularity-conditions}{%
\paragraph{4.1.1 Regularity conditions}\label{regularity-conditions}}

(This is a review of material covered in homework and lecture examples).
Solve for the MLE. Identify any violations of regularity conditions.

\hypertarget{bias-of-the-mle}{%
\paragraph{4.1.2 Bias of the MLE}\label{bias-of-the-mle}}

Solve for the bias given \(n\). Is it possible to construct an unbiased
estimator based on your solution? Also, is the MLE asymptotically
unbiased?

\hypertarget{confidence-intervals}{%
\subsubsection{4.2 Confidence intervals}\label{confidence-intervals}}

Let \(Y_{(n)}\) be the \(n\)th order statistic (i.e., the maximum of
observations). Consider the two interval estimators:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \([a Y_{(n)}, b Y_{(n)}]\), where \(1 \leq a \leq b\)
\item
  \([c + Y_{(n)}, d + Y_{(n)}]\), where \(0 \leq c \leq d\)
\end{enumerate}

In which of these cases does the coverage probability depend on
\(\theta\)?

\hypertarget{poisson-fun-times}{%
\subsection{5 Poisson fun times}\label{poisson-fun-times}}

Let \(Y_1, \dots, Y_n \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} \textrm{Pois}(\lambda)\).

\hypertarget{poisson-nef}{%
\subsubsection{5.1 Poisson NEF}\label{poisson-nef}}

Show that the Poisson is a member of the NEF and use properties of the
NEF to determine the MLE and its asymptotic distribution

\hypertarget{confidence-interval-using-mle}{%
\subsubsection{5.2 Confidence interval using
MLE}\label{confidence-interval-using-mle}}

Using the results from (5.1), construct an asymptotic
\(100(1 - \alpha)\) percent confidence interval.

\hypertarget{confidence-interval}{%
\subsubsection{5.3 Confidence interval}\label{confidence-interval}}

Replace the estimand in (5.2) with an appropriate statistic to construct
an alternate 100(1−α) percent CI.
